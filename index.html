<em class="profile__lead">My richness of experience and skill</em>
<p class="profile__text">I have over 5 years of professional experience, serving over 100 clients, developing Corporate Websites, LP, SPA, Forms, CMS, and Desktop App from both of frontend and backend perspectives.</p>
<p class="profile__text">The rich is not only experience but also my skill, which is from current mainstream technologies, such as TypeScript, Next.js, Nuxt.js, to developing tools, such as Git, CI/CD.</p>
<p class="profile__text">With those riches, one of feature of my development is to be done with flexibility and well-optimization, because those makes me possible to deal with a complexity or sudden-change of project requirement definition, because those makes me possible to select which technology is suitable for every single project to optimize from technical and methodological perspectives.</p>

<em class="profile__lead">My developing policy</em>
<p class="profile__text">My development policy is 'Not only appearance but also emphasis on the inner qualities'.</p>
<p class="profile__text">Inner qualities mean aspects that are difficult to be seen and realized by the application UI, such as Accessibility, Usability, Performance, and Readability.<br>Those are inclined to be underestimated, but I believe they are crucial factors in Web Development.<br>Since web applications are intended to be used by people, developers should create them to be usable by whoever, whenever, and wherever, and pursue excellence much further.</p>
<p class="profile__text">That is why I manipulate various kinds of tools, such as Lighthouse, Google Dev Tools, Linter, etc. Especially with Lighthouse, I engage in trial-and-error as much as possible to improve the score of each section and enhance the application significantly.</p>

<td><p>I created a calendar app to deepen my understanding of two aspects: the latest technologies in React and the integration of client-side and server-side development.</p><p>In my previous workplace, there were cases where responsibilities were highly specialized, leading to separate development of front-end and back-end. This often resulted in integrating these components in the final stages of the project.</p><p>Therefore, wanting to enhance my understanding of the integration, I intentionally assumed separate development responsibilities for each and created them in distinct repositories, then integrated these components via a proxy server.</p><p>As a result, I gained valuable insights into optimal project directory structures, HTTP endpoint configurations, proxy server setup, and use cases for such development methodologies.</p></td>

In addition to I focused on decent data manipulation as reinvestigating usages of Axious and Vuex, and the concept of Restful API.</p><p>What I re-realized this time was the importance of updating my knowledge about the web and incorporating the latest technologies into everyday web development by regularly developing private applications and delving deep into specific fields.</p><p>Regarding Vue.js, there had been significant updates since my previous knowledge, improving code readability and performance in app development.

<td><p>I privately developed Chat App imitating some WhatsApp App functionalities. The core of the App is the mutual communication realized by Websocket implemented with Node.js's Socket.IO library.</p><p>Until then, I only knew HTTP as the communication protocol between the client-side and server-side. However, through this project, I learned about a new communication protocol called WebSocket, and I gained an understanding of its usefulness. Particularly, the ability to send information from the server-side to the client-side, which is not present in HTTP, was a concept that I found meaningful for future web application development.</p></td>

<td><p>I developed this Desktop Application to reduce the working hours spent on chronic routine tasks.</p><p>In my previous company, we had one client paying us over $2,000,000 annually and giving a plenty of tasks almost all day and parallelly. When each task finished, they required us a unique workflow for delivering a creation to get rid of any problems. That workflow was done with Git and double-check by other team member, and easy for one step but needed many steps to be done, such as frequent branch changes, or request message for double-check to others. Additionally this workflow had to be done many times a day by almost of all members of our team. It means that the total time spending for this client was huge.</p><p>Therefore I developed this App. By filling the blanks with necessary information for the workflow on the application screen, it became possible to automatically and mechanically complete the followings, to switch branches, to generate request messages to other team members, and to detect potential errors. In other words, the workflow became to be done with a few steps.</p><p>Consequently this App significantly contributed to reducing time within the team.</p></td>

<p class="strength__text">I am an effective communicator with team members and clients. To proceed our tasks properly I mainly focus on 3 points below.</p>



<dl class="strength__desc">

<dt>Grasp Other's Opinion</dt>
<dd>I properly grasp other people's points of view by giving them enough opportunities and time to express their opinion with comfortable atmosphere, and carefully listen with asking precise questions.</dd>

<dt>Give My Opinion</dt>
<dd>I always try giving my opinion with thinking about what is the better way to make my opinion understandable for other people, and the impact of their feeling and motivation. However not only those but also I put my emotion onto my opinion to tell how I think and feel. It is depending on the situation, though.</dd>

<dt>Consider Other's Circumstance'</dt>
<dd>Thoughts and opinions are influenced by various factors such as the current situation, a person's personality, and background. Therefore, I am always conscious of considering these factors and strive to understand indirect elements, such as why they arrived at certain thoughts.</dd>

<div class="strength__textArea">


<p class="strength__text">When I work, I value consideration. This is because consideration brings positive outcomes in various aspects, such as effective communication with others, efficiency in work, and contributions to team motivation. Below, I provide three examples of my consideration:</p>



<dl class="strength__desc">

<dt>Consideration for Others</dt>
<dd>I consistently take into account the perspectives and needs of team members, fostering a collaborative relationship and atmosphere in working environment.</dd>

<dt>Consideration for Decision-Making</dt>
<dd>My decision-making process is characterized by thoughtful consideration, where I analyze information comprehensively and evaluate the potential influence on both short-term goals and long-term objectives.</dd>

<dt>Consideration for UI and UX</dt>
<dd>I consider from different types of perspectives, such as accessibility, usability, performance, and readability, as a developer by trying to imagine myself as a user of the application or a client who is supposed to release it.</dd>

<p class="strength__text">I am proactive in finding ways for improving daily simple processes or solving existing problems. It always results in great breakthrough and efficiency increase.</p>



<p class="strength__text">The followings are examples how I am proactive.</p>



<dl class="strength__desc">

<dt>Learn Technique Accelerating My Work</dt>
<dd>Developers tend to focus on learning new programming languages and concepts, but I also put importance onto learning techniques that make my daily developing accelerate and facilitate. Regex, Linux command, usuful npm package or VSCode extensions, and deeper understanding about usages of each developing tool are matched to it.</dd>

<dt>Create Usuful Desktop App</dt>
<dd>In my previous company, I actively created a desktop application using Electron, implemented with an intuitive UI, to reduce the working hours spent on chronic routine tasks. This application simplified manual processes such as file transfers, message sending, and Git operations, bundling them into a few app interactions. As a result, it significantly shortened the overall team working hours.</dd>

<dt>Share and Share</dt>
<dd>I share what I thought useful among my team. I believe this activity makes share-and-share circulation and all developers can automatically improve their developing way.</dd>

<p class="strength__text">I approach my tasks with a keen attention to detail. I firmly believe that being detail-oriented directly impacts the quality of a project. I do not compromise on quality and am committed to enhancing it by paying careful attention to every detail.</p>



<p class="strength__text">In terms of web development, I go beyond surface-level of coding and focus on the following 4 perspectives.</p>



<dl class="strength__desc">

<dt>Accessibility</dt>
<dd>Ensuring services are usable by individuals facing any challenges.</dd>

<dt>Performance</dt>
<dd>Optimizing the seamless operation under any environments.</dd>

<div class="strength__textArea">


<p class="strength__text">I consistently deepen and broaden my understanding of programming languages and systematic concepts. This effort is not only to keep pace with the rapid changes in the IT mainstream but also to increase what I can contribute to the company and projects.</p>



<p class="strength__text">To achieve this commitment, I focus on the following three points:</p>



<dl class="strength__desc">

<dt>First</dt>
<dd>Investigating any unknown expertises encountered during work, promptly researching them, and if it is time-consuming, taking notes, and then making dedicated time to research them.</dd>

<dt>Second</dt>
<dd>Allocating 30 minutes each day to explore new technologies and areas where my understanding may be lacking.</dd>

<p class="strength__text">I possess adaptability to complicated environments or technologies. I believe that it is a crucial trait for successful development in IT field. The reasons are the followings.</p>



<dl class="strength__desc">

<dt>Technologies Changes Rapidly</dt>
<dd>Technologies changes with fast-pace. That is why adaptability and quick-learning are required any time, to make optimal proposals that meet the needs of our client, and to develop in the best way at that moment.</dd>

<dt>Collaboration with Various People</dt>
<dd>Many people are involving in a project. Some are in different position. Others are in charge of different technologies. To advance our project smoothly, we need to adapt to circumstance and collaborate each other.</dd>

<dt>We Do Not Have Enough Time</dt>
<dd>Developing an application frequently requires hard-working due to short deadline, delay of schedule, or immidiate necesity of creating a mockup. To be honest, there is not time for adapting in such case. We need to adapt in no time and allocate as much time as possible for development.</dd>
